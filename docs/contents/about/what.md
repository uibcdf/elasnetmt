# What is ElasNetMT?


ElasNetMT —**Elas**tic **Net**works **M**ulti**T**oolkit— is a scientific
open-source Python library designed to facilitate work with elastic network
models of biomolecules.

This library was developed to provide a user-friendly interface for
computational structural biology labs, such as the UIBCDF [UIBCDF](https://www.uibcdf.org/), to use in their
research. With ElasNetMT, you can streamline the integration of workflows involving
Gaussian Network Models (GNM), Anisotropic Network Models (ANM), and related
elastic network approaches applied to proteins, complexes, and biomolecular
assemblies including cofactors or ions.

ElasNetMT is an open-source project shared under the [MIT
license](https://github.com/uibcdf/elasnetmt/blob/main/LICENSE). This means
that you have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense, and/or sell copies without any limitations.

If you have suggestions, improvements, enhancement proposals, if you miss a
functionality, or you have identified a bug or a malfunction, feel free to
contribute to its development or interact with the authors and contributors by
using the [MolSysMT public GitHub repository](https://github.com/uibcdf/elasnetmt).

When using ElasNetMT, it is important to understand that the authors and
